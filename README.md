🚀 Migrating On-Prem Infrastructure to AWS Cloud: A Success Story 🚀

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a cloud migration project for a client, DMSYSTEMS, who was looking to scale their web and mobile applications while improving redundancy. The existing setup was hosted on bare metal servers in a single data center, and with growing customer demand, the need for a more scalable and resilient infrastructure became urgent.

The Challenge:
Scaling: As customer traffic increased, the current infrastructure faced performance bottlenecks.
Redundancy: With a single data center, there was a risk of downtime impacting operations.
Cost Management: The client wanted to migrate to the cloud while keeping cost efficiency in mind, especially with their existing CRM and ERP systems on-prem.
The Solution:
I designed a solution leveraging AWS Cloud Services to meet the scaling and redundancy needs while keeping operational costs in check:

🌐 Web and Mobile Applications: Deployed Apache servers on EC2 instances within public subnets, with traffic managed through Load Balancers and Auto-Scaling Groups to handle user traffic fluctuations seamlessly.
🔒 REST API: Hosted on EC2 instances within private subnets to ensure security, with MySQL on RDS for the database, supported by an RDS Read Replica to balance read-heavy workloads.
📧 Mail Service: Integrated Amazon SES for handling the application's mail functionalities, ensuring reliable and cost-effective email communication.
📊 Monitoring & Logging: Configured CloudWatch for real-time logging and monitoring, enabling quick identification of issues.
👥 On-Premise Retention: To reduce costs, the existing on-prem infrastructure was retained for the CRM/ERP systems. A VPN Tunnel was set up to securely connect the on-prem systems with the AWS cloud infrastructure, with a Load Balancer distributing traffic between servers.
This project not only enhanced scalability and redundancy but also optimized operational costs by retaining parts of the existing infrastructure. A perfect blend of cloud adoption with cost-conscious decision-making!

💡 Key Takeaway: By combining AWS Cloud Services with strategic retention of on-prem systems, businesses can scale efficiently without breaking the bank. This hybrid approach provided flexibility while ensuring high availability.
